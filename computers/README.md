# The clients

This directory contains the install scripts for programs and configurations for the client PCs, managed by the mgmt machine.

## Boot procedure

The mgmt hosts a PXE server. The boot menu can be entered by smashing the F7 key. From there on, Linux mint should radically install itself onto the machines without asking for permission.
