# MGMT

This directory contains some scripts that are used to set up the mgmt server.

## Install

Here are the files to perform a presseded installation of the Debian operating system.

## Setup

Here are files used to setup the services on the mgmt server.
All files are written with the intent of being idempotent: They can be run an arbitrary number of times and always leave the system in the same state.
The scripts set up the pxe boot server with the current linux mint version.
